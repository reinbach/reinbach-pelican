Over the last few years I have been very interested in the Python programming language andd learning the ins and outs of it. But for whatever reason have not really taken to it. Most of my development is for the web and so have always looked at a language to see how that could help me. And with Python I had not found anything that worked well for me with the web. mod_python just didn't do it for me.

Well that was until I came across TurboGears [<a href="http://www.turbogears.org">http://www.turbogears.org</a>] Very much along the lines of Rails. Just set it up on my machine and going through it, and so far it is very impressive. Maybe this will be the tipping point for me to really get to learn Python.
