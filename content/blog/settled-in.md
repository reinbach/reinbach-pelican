Ok it has been a while since my last posting, but we are now settled in and I have redone the website, finally. So hopefully it will be a lot easier to manage, which will see me posting more content to the site - time will tell.

The latest news is that I am now working for <a href='http://www.intechjanus.com'>INTECH</a> as a Web Application Developer. I must say I am extremely happy at the moment. The people there are extremely knowledgeable in their fields and the environment is great.

On the personal side Laura and I are going to be attempting to do some Triahtlons etc, this is really a goal we have set, that will see us getting back into shape. It has been a while since we were last in shape. I have been running a bit lately, so we are making slow progress, but progress nevertheless.

We have just bought a minivan on eBay of all places and need to pick it up next week, so that is exciting. Sadly that will see us retiring the white subaru, which has served us well over the last few years. Sadly the lack of airconditioning is a big issue here in Florida, go figure. Also the body is taking great strain with rust appearing everywhere. And not to mention the hubcabs going walk about. Lost one, but was able to recover the other as I saw it rolling down the road!

That's it for news, have some other content to get up.
