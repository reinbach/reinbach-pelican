I have been working on a travel blogging web application called Travelz Log [<a href="http://www.travelzlog.com">www.travelzlog.com</a>] and it has just moved into early beta. It is still a little rough around the edges and needs quite a bit of testing still.

Over the next few weeks I plan to smooth out those edges and move it out of beta. Then over time add new features to it and grow the application. There is already a fair list of enhancements that I want to do, but first want to shore up the base and make sure it is solid first.

I would appreciate any help in testing the application, so if you have a moment or two, please head over to <a href="http://www.travelzlog.com">www.travelzlog.com</a> and click around and then send me your feedback.
