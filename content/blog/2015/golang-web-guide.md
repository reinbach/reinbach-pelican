A multi-part article about developing a website with Golang, with each article about a specific piece of functionality that is common for a complete website.

Previously I have done a large amount of development with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. I like it because it has everything and it allows one to develop a website quickly, and so there will be a lot of influence from that in these articles.

The reason I made use of Golang is because I wanted to see how simple it would be to implement a lot of this functionality with mainly the Golang standard packages.

So following articles are available;

   * [Templating](/golang-web-templating.html)
   * Testing
   * Multiple Apps
   * Config
   * Form
   * Database
   * Logging
   * Session
   * Auth
   * Cli

Each article attempts to cover a particular piece of functionality needed in a website.
Source code is available on github at [golang-webapp-guide](https://github.com/reinbach/golang-webapp-guide)

A while back I wrote about implementing [basic site](/golang-webapps-1.html) functionality, this will expand on that a lot more.
