Lately I have done some work with Google Maps and made use of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmaps/">jMaps</a> which is a jQuery Google Maps Plugin.

Nice and straight forward to use, just a one liner to initialize the map and you have access to quite of bit of functionality through the <a href="http://map.ifies.org/">API</a>. I was able to make use of markers and polylines without any real issues.

At the moment I can connect an object on the page to a marker on the map, kinda, I make use of the latitude and longitude values. Just need to work out how to connect a marker to an object on the page.

Also just don't forget to signup for your <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">Google Map Key</a>
