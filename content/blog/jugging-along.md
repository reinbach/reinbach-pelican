Have made a few quick releases of JaG CMS, due to a couple of issues that were identified as well as a few small improvements made. So JaG CMS is settling down really nicely at the moment.

Have moved onto the development of modules for JaG CMS, wanting to make it simple and easy to develop/create modules that can be added and removed easily from the core code base.

The first module that is being worked on is a catalog module with the idea that this will a part of an online shopping system that sits on JaG CMS.
