I have been working on a Joomla based project and it has just moved into Beta phase. Zonelancer is a freelancing website that brings togther freelancers and those needing freelancers.

We made use of an already made module/component for Joomla and templated it. A few minor tweaks were made to the modules/components as well as a new module created to handle the stats.

You can get a glimpse of the site at <a href="http://zonelancer.reinbach.com">zonelancer.reinbach.com</a>
