Well that's a first, I was moving my monitoring system to a new server and decided to go back to using Nagios instead
if Icinga and was looking into setting up NRPE on the remote server and did a quick Google on that and lo and behold
the first entry in the Google results was an entry written by me on how to do that :)

You would think I would remember that I write these things. Anyway, it is fun seeing that there.

Well the fun was short lived, when I realized the link did not work. I had just updated my DNS for the domain and
forgotten to setup the leading 'www.' for the domain... doh!
