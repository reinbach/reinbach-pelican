Still working on learning game development and the first step is to create a text adventure game, so says all the articles on learning game development.

So that is something I have done. The storyline is pretty much non-existant, but the programming part of it is there. I think, anyway. I actually enjoyed creating this more than I thought I would.

The nice part about it is that the framework is there. The storyling and flow of the adventure is added to the mapping.py and text.py files. So it is simple enough to develop the storyline into something reasonable. Definitely need to work on my storylines.
