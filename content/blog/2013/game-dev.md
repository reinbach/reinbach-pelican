I've decided I want to develop a game(s) and this is the start of that process.

I've been developing websites and web applications for over 10 years and I am looking to do something different.
I still very much enjoy developing web applications and that is still what I do on a fulltime basis.

Now I want to develop games and do something a little differently, to learn new languages and create something other than web applications. I have always been interested in games, seeing that I play them a lot and my boys are growing up and playing them as well. So this would be something more to interact with them on as well. They can be my beta testers.

So this is going to be my little side project for a while. I expect it will take me probably about 5 years to develop a reasonable game, seeing that I have a lot to learn. The web applications I develop use Python mainly and sure you can develop games using Python with PyGame libs etc, but I want to make use of C/C++ or maybe Go (will need a lot od libs developed) as I want to learn more languages and expect the game I want to develop will need to make use of a faster language.

So it is safe to say that I am really clueless at the moment about game development, so this will be a long journey and that is ok. I'll keep doing it so long as I am enjoying it. I'm not wanting to work for any game development company, I want to have a lot of freedom in deciding on what and how I do things. This is a hobby for me and I want it to be fun.


I think my first steps are;

- to initially go back and really learn C as a good basis.
- learn how to use [Blender](http://www.blender.org/)


My expectations are;

- to have fun
- learn new things
- this is going to be a long and slow process.
- doing something completely different to what I'm doing now
- maybe sell a game or 2
