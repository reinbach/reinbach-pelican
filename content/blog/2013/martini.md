Still playing with golang and [Martini](http://codebot.io/doc/pkg/github.com/codegangsta/martini) is a package that I think I will be doing a lot of work with, seeing that web applications are what I am constantly working on.

The nice thing about Martini is that it relies heavily on net/http and it a very thin layer to it. Creating a web application is straight forward and simple enough. It will be interesting to work on a larger application with it to get a better feel for it.

These tutorials on it were interesting and helpful;

   * [Build a Christmas List with Martini](http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-11-martini)
   * [Build a RESTful API with Martini](http://0value.com/build-a-restful-API-with-Martini)
