Golang has been a fascination for some time, and I have finally jumped in and started learning about the language.

Started off with the [Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org), and lately the [Go Advent](http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-advent-2013) has been very helpful. The Go Advent series was really nice as it introduced a wide varied list of applications/uses of go. A number of them that I would not have even looked at or been aware of.

I've just finished going through the [By Example](https://gobyexample.com/) list, which was great as I find this method is the best way for me to learn. The next step is to work on a personal project and actually put together something using Go.

The question is what exactly should that project be.
