So I have been slowly working through the [Noob to Pro](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro) wikibook.
Finally I am starting to understand the UI to Blender! I've just reached the section on animation.

Blender is a tool that I have always wanted to learn how to use. I have been aware of Blender since the days when the
community bought it from the company that went bankrupt and open sourced it. That was a number of years ago.
And now I am actually able to do a few little things with it.

The only thing with the 'Noob to Pro' wikibook is that a number of the tutorials are for older versions of blender
and I have some trouble converting the steps to the new UI.

I have now just realized the the [User Manual](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual) is a lot more up to
date with the latest version of Blender and it appears to be a better starting point in learning Blender.
So now I am working through that, I've just gotten through the first few chapters/pages.

I have also been lurking in a number of forums on reddit. Mainly;

   * [Linux Gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming)
   * [Game Dev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/)
   * [Indie Gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/)

And I am learning quite a bit from the postings there, from resources for programming to what to do to learn to draw.
