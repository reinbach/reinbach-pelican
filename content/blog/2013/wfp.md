I have resigned from CashStar and I am now contracting with World Food Programme ([wfp.org](http://www.wfp.org)). This is my attempt to do good in the world, for my work to have meaning and to be a positive effect on society or the world. All that feel good stuff.

Granted I am not doing anything specifically that is having a profound effect on the world, or that I am not tackling some huge coding problem personally. But I believe the work I am doing now is a small contribution, and the sum of our parts in the organization is having a great impact on humanity and that makes me feel good.

WFP is a large organization and things move slowly compared to what I am used to. I am coming from a startup where things happened quickly. So that is going to be a bit of a transistion and something that I need to keep in mind.

On the opposite side of the coin, I think that WFP will have a much better life / work balance and that counts for a lot in my book.

As with everything there are pros and cons, but this is something that I have been wanting to do for some time now and I am very excited to be actually doing it.
