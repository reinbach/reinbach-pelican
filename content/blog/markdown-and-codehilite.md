Just added a quick article on how I installed and worked with <a href="http://python.reinbach.com/cms/markdown-and-codehilite/">markdown and codehilite</a>. These tools helped in presenting code snippets in the articles with ease. It allows the article to be edited easily and makes use of markdown syntax.

When adding the article it is parsed and html syntax is added to the text based on the markdown syntax. This method then only requires the text to be parsed when it is added/updated and not everytime the article is viewed.
