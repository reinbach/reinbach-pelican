Lately I have been playing around with various JS Graphing libraries. In the past I have made use of <a href="http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/">Plotkit</a>, which is based on the <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> libs. Overall it is a very straight forward application and easy to use. 

But in wanting to make use of <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> more and to get more up to speed with it, I came across <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a> and decided to give it a whirl on the Powerball app.
