That's right, we are heading East to North Conway, New Hamshire. Do not know where we will be staying exactly at the moment, that is still being decided. Will be renting at first though. But we have been offered a position at a small company called Glen Group [<a href="www.glengroup.com">www.glengroup.com</a>] Joining their web deparment and hopefully going to be doing some great things there.
<br />
Will keep you all posted as to our location details etc.
<br />
We head out on the 6th December and hope to be in a place by the 12th December at the latest. Not sure how long it will take us to get connected to the Net though!
