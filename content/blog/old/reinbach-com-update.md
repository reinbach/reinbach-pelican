Made some simple updates to the site, making it more functional and fixed a few bugs. Also cleaned up the menu and the work section bringing it up to date.

On a new schedule that sees me getting up way before the crack of dawn. Now getting up around 4am, I like this time of day as it is very quiet, most of the family not running around like crazy, so I can get some decent work done. This also sees me crashing real early in the evening.
