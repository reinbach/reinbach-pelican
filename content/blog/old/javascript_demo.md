A <a href="http://www.reinbach.com/portfolio/javascript/">javascript demo</a> has been added that encompasses DOM manipulation, effects and AJAX.

The idea of the javascript snippet of code is that it can be placed in a form that has a select list pulling data from a lookup table and would allow the user to add to the lookup table without having to leave the form.

The javascript code sends a request to a PHP file on the server that adds the data to the database. A new list of the categories is returned in JSON format and that is parsed into the new options list for the categories.
