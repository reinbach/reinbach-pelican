We order from a Co-op and Laura has a tough time finding the products with the best price and determining what to order in general. Looking at their site they offered an Excel doc each month with the products. So I decided to create a website for Laura to use and maybe others would be interested in it as well.

I wrote a script that parses this Excel document and puts all the products into a database. The website allows a user to search the products and if they create an account to add products to a shopping cart.

The idea is that over time I will add more functionality, like order history etc.
