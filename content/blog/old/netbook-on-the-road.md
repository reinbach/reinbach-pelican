I have just returned from a trip on which I used the netbook exclusively. At the end of the trip I am very happy to say that I was able to do all that I needed to on the netbook, I was able to develop without many issues.

Although it is a little slower than my desktop, that is expected. It just required me to be a little more patient. The one issue that I did have, was not able to review my work via IE. I installed VirtualBox and moved across a snapshot of a Windows partition and was able to run Windows virtually on the netbook, but IE was not allowing me to view local websites running on the netbook. I probably do not have the correct IP or something along those lines, granted I made no effort to resolve this, but will in the next week or so, as that is something that I will need. Did not really need it while on the trip.

So all in all very happy with the netbook, can't complain as it was very cheap and did what I wanted it to do. So now I am mobile in a big way.
