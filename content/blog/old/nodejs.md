Lately I'm doing more and more Javascript development and attempting to improve my skill set there. And I'm finding that I am using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) more in development and when learning Javascript.

It's very handy to be able to write a snippet of Javascript code in your default editor and then use node to run it. Especially for learning and just trying something out. I find that a lot better than trying to make use of the browser Javscript consoles or scratch pads.

Also Node is really fantastic when making use of testacular etc for running the various unit and end to end tests on ones project.

I'm not mkaing use of Node just yet in production as I'm happy with my current production setup (nginx, uwsgi) and would rather continue to keep that simple and minimal for now.
