Over the weekend I installed the monitoring service provided by ServerDensity, and was very impressed with how simple it was to install and get up and running. 
They monitor a number of services, including databases like MySQL, MongoDB etc, but not PostgreSQL. So seeing that they have a plugin framework and I have a PostgreSQL instance running on my servers, I thought I would look into writing a plugin for it.
