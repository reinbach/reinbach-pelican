We are currently in South Africa having a fantastic time with the family. Just spent a week in mBona with everyone and it was fantastic. Sadly our holiday is coming to an end and we will have to head home on Monday (2nd). Have had plenty of time to chill and have some big ideas for the new year and the years to follow. We shall see if I can implement them.
