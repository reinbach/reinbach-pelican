Been working steadily on JaG CMS of late, almost there with it.

It is a simple website CMS system, that allows a user to manage a website, by adding/editing pages and content. Have not made a code release as yet, but that should be in the next week or so. Having to complete the installation script and we should be able to make the first release.
