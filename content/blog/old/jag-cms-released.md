Have just made our first release of JaG CMS on sourceforge [<a href="http://www.jagcms.com">jagcms.com</a>]
That was a big milestone for us, to actually get it out there. The basic premise of the CMS is completed and from here it should just be simple tweaks and probably many bug fixes, but I believe it is not a bad release.

Now to let developers know about it so more testing can be performed and some feedback generated. That should help us to make sure it is a decent product.
