I have been playing with django of late as well as doing some fair amount of python scripting at work.

So for a mini project I played with the powerball lottery numbers and created a very simple application that pulls the numbers from the powerball lottery website and dump them in a database and then extract some data from the database and present them.

All that has resulted in a couple of pages that can be found at <a href="http://python.reinbach.com/powerball">python.reinbach.com/powerball</a>. These pages show the results and explain with code snippets the underlying code.

I made use of django for the web framework and MySQL for the database and python for the script that fetches the numbers from the official powerball website.
