Coded a new word press template for <a href="http://www.gsimedia.net">GSI Media</a> called Urban Groove. It was a little interesting in that a fair amount of transparencies were used and this does not play well with IE6.

The design was also a little narrow relative to other wordpress templates, but I thought it was a really cool looking design.
