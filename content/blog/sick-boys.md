Well Ethan has been really sick for the past week, but thankfully he is on the mend slowly. He was really out of it last weekend. He could barely move and has lost a lot of weight.
<br />
Trying to get him to take his medicine is an ordeal and has not helped much at all. But he is now eating like a champ and sounding a lot perkier.
<br />
Not to be out done Luke has now fallen sick as well, but does not look to be as bad as what Ethan had. He has a barking cough at the moment, but his spirits are still high.
