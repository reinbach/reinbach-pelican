Crikey, I'm buggered!!!! We have moved 90% of our stuff, just have one more trip to get non-essential things I think.

But am very glad to have gotten the majority of the things to the new place. We are spending our first night at the new place, bed is setup, and am loving it. But I'm tired now and am ready to crash.

Tomorrow will just be returning the Rental truck, hit Costco for a couple of things and maybe, if I'm up to it, making that last run to the old place for the last of our things.

Home Sweet Home!
